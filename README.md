# DegenToken Smart Contract
The **DegenToken** smart contract is an ERC20 token built with Solidity `^0.8.18` and OpenZeppelin libraries, featuring a Valorant-inspired virtual skin marketplace. The token, named **Degen** (symbol: **DGN**), is non-divisible (0 decimals) and can be minted by the owner, transferred, or burned by users. Players can redeem in-game skins using DGN tokens, with predefined skins stored on-chain, each having a unique ID, name, and price. Upon redemption, tokens are burned, and the skins are added to the user's inventory, which can be viewed through the `SkinInventory` function. The contract supports standard ERC20 functionality, enabling a simple, tokenized in-game economy for distributing and redeeming virtual assets.
